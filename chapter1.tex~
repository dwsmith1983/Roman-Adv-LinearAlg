\begin{exercise}
\item
  Let \(V\) be a vector space over \(F\).
  Prove that \(0v = 0\) and \(r0 = 0\) for all \(v\in V\) and \(r\in F\).
  Describe the different \(0\)'s in these equations.
  Prove that if \(rv = 0\), then \(r = 0\) or \(v = 0\).
  Prove that \(rv = v\) implies that \(v = 0\) or \(r = 1\).
\item
  Prove theorem \(1.3:\) The set \(S(V)\) of all subspaces of a vector space
  \(V\) is a complete lattice under set inclusion, with smallest element
  \(\{0\}\), largest element \(V\), meet
  \[
  \glb\{S_i\colon i\in K\} = \bigcap_{i\in K}S_i
  \]
  and join
  \[
  \lub\{S_i\colon i\in K\} = \sum_{i\in K}S_i.
  \]
\item
  \begin{exercise}[label = (\alph*)]
  \item
    Find an abelian group \(V\) and a field \(F\) for which \(V\) is a vector
    space over \(F\) in at least two different ways, that is, there are two
    different definitions of scalar multiplication making \(V\) a vector space
    over \(F\).
  \item
    Find a vector space \(V\) over \(F\) and a subset \(S\) of \(V\) that is
    \begin{enumerate*}[label = (\arabic*)]
    \item
      a subspace of \(V\) and
    \item
      a vector space using operations that differ from those of \(V\).
    \end{enumerate*}
  \end{exercise}
\item
  Suppose that \(V\) is a vector space with basis
  \(\mathcal{B} = \{b_i\colon i\in I\}\) and \(S\) is a subspace of \(V\).
  Let \(\{B_1,\ldots,B_k\}\) be a partition of \(\mathcal{B}\).
  Then is it true that
  \[
  S = \bigoplus_{i = 1}^k(S\cap\langle B_i\rangle)
  \]
  What if \(S\cap\langle B_i\rangle\neq\varnothing\) for all \(i\)?
